# AI Applications in Software Engineering

## Overview
This project explores how Artificial Intelligence enhances software engineering through automation, predictive analytics, and intelligent testing. It combines theory, practical implementation, and ethical reflection.

## Tools & Technologies
- GitHub Copilot (AI code completion)
- Selenium (AI-assisted automated testing)
- Scikit-learn (Predictive analytics)
- Pandas, NumPy
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

## Project Tasks

### Task 1: AI-Powered Code Completion
- Python function for sorting dictionaries
- Comparison between AI-generated and manual code
- Efficiency and maintainability analysis

### Task 2: Automated Testing with AI
- Selenium-based login test
- Valid and invalid credential testing
- Explanation of AI-driven test coverage

### Task 3: Predictive Analytics
- Breast Cancer Dataset (Kaggle)
- Random Forest model
- Accuracy and F1-score evaluation

## Ethical Reflection
- Bias risks in training data
- Fairness mitigation using IBM AI Fairness 360
- Responsible AI deployment practices
